        to change element background color simply type background-color in css file
        we can choose color with different ways:
        - color name (not all colors have a name)
        - RGB intensity (mix red, green, and blue to create color)
        - hexdecimal color code starting from 00 for RGB till ff == 255
        we can choose an image to be a background using an image url
        default background image repeat value is repeat (repeat in both directions x and y)
        can choose how to repeat:
        - repeat (repeats an image in two directions x and y)
        - repeat-x (repeats in x dimension only)
        - repeat-y (repeats in y dimension only)
        - no-repeat (a single image to show)
        Note: element background color will show if element dimensions exceed background image dimension
        default background attachment value is scroll (scroll element background as you go)
        attachment values to choose from:
        - scroll (default value and allow scrolling element background image)
        - fixed (fix it as you scroll the element content)
        background position controls where you want to position your background image
        we can choose from 5 positions:
        - left, right, center, top, bottom
        we use them in pairs and center can substitute any value:
        - left top  or  top left
        - right center  or  center right
        - center center ..etc
        Note: if declared only one position the other default to center:
        - top  or  bottom
        - right  or  left
        - center
        we can specify a numeric value in pixels or element ratio
        we control x-position then y-position:
        - 200px 10px (position 200 pixels in x direction and 10 pixels in y direction)
        - 50% 0% (position at 50 percent of element x-dimension and 0 percent of element y-dimension)
        we can change background image size:
        - auto (default value and uses image original size)
        - cover (fill element size space and stretch to fit bigger sizes)
        - contain (all the image is visible shrink or stretch to fit in smaller and bigger sizes)
        we can specify a numeric value in pixels or element ratio
        we control x-position then y-position
        - 100px 200px (size 100 pixels in x direction and 200 pixels in y direction)
        - 20% 40% (size 20 percent of element's x-dimension and 40 percent of element's y-dimension)
        Note: be carefull when using numerics it could change background image quality
