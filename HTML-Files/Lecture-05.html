    <!--
        to change element background color simply type background-color in css file
        we can choose color with different ways:
        - color name (not all colors have a name)
        - RGB intensity (mix red, green, and blue to create color)
        - hexdecimal color code starting from 00 for RGB till ff == 255
        we can choose an image to be a background using an image url
        default background image repeat value is repeat (repeat in both directions x and y)
        can choose how to repeat:
        - repeat (repeats an image in two directions x and y)
        - repeat-x (repeats in x dimension only)
        - repeat-y (repeats in y dimension only)
        - no-repeat (a single image to show)
        Note: element background color will show if element dimensions exceed background image dimension
