      Element inheritance 
      Child elements should inherite from its parent most properities
      but not all like:
      div => h3:
        h3 inherits text-alignment and text-size
        and doesn't padding, background-color, or border
        although text-size wouldn't apply to h3 (it has different text-size)
      any child could change inherited properties by specifying it a new value
      inherited properities inherited to childrens of childs also and so on
      we can assign inherit value to any property to make it inherit its value from parent to the top parent
