        nesting is the most important method in css
        nesting means selecting an element nested in another one
        like folders and subfolders and how your can navigate through
        if you need to choose paragraph element inside the div
        - div p (it's different from grouping a space separating elements means nested)
        nesting applies for all selectors (class, id, element name, etc.)
