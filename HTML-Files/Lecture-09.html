        border in css language like cell formatting in word or other processing languages
        border needs three grouped values to be defined (width, color, style)
        border-width or color or style is a short hand for four properities (Top, Right, Bottom, Left)
        border surronds element and it's between margin and padding
        border-width, color and style need 4 values
        starting from top and clock wise (Top, Right, Bottom, Left)
        when a single value is present it means equal border in all directions:
        - 10px (element borders 10 pixels in top, right, bottom, left borders away from element start)
        when two values it means missing values equal opposite to them
        - 10px 20px (element borders 10 pixels in top & bottom and 20 pixels in right & left borders away from element start)
        when three values it means missing values equal opposite to them
        - 10px 20px 15px (Top 10px, Right 20px, Bottom 15px, left equal to right 20px)
        we can specify only one border value by choosing it
        - border-width-bottom: 10px (like border-width: 0 0 10px)
        and the same for other groups but values differ
        border-color values would choose from color pallete by name or RGB or HSL or Hexadecimal
        border-style values could choose from different styles would change border visualization
        - solid (a solid continous line )
        - dashed (a dashed line -----)
        - dotted (a dotted line .....) and etc.
        border short hand without any grouping would accept 3 values:
        - border: 10px solid red; (width, style, color):
        means (border-width: 10px; border-style: solid; border-color: red)
        and each group accept one value only and it would apply same value for other (top, right, bottom, left)
        when you need different border values according to your style design dont' use short hand border
